    "## Story:\n",
    "During the 1990s, Professor John Eccleston and Dr Richard Wilson at the University of Queensland ran a simple randomised controlled trial with 110 students in their classes. The students began by measuring and recording their own pulse rates. Then, by coin toss each student was randomly allocated to one of two groups. Tossing heads on the coin meant the students had to run on the spot for one minute. Students throwing tails were asked to sit for one minute instead of running. Pulse rates were again recorded after the one minute of running or sitting. Running for a minute served as a treatment and sitting as a control condition, with pulse rate the outcome measure. Background data about the students such as their weight, height, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption and frequency of exercise were added to the running or sitting and pulse rate information for each student.1 Using these data we can test the effect of brief exercise and student characteristics on immediate heart rate. The advantage of this informal experiment is that we can easily predict its main findings. Everyone knows the effect of sudden physical activity on immediate heartbeat\n",
