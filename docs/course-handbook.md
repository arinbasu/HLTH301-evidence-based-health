# HLTH301: Evidence in Health

## Description

"HLTH 301: Evidence in Health Care" aims to provide an overview of the nature of evidence, including current definitions and its evaluation and use in health care delivery decisions in a variety of settings. This is a 0.25 EFTS course (30 points course). This means you will need to spend 10 hours per week studying HLTH301 this semester (full time study hours per week = 40 hours). As critical appraisal of evidence is a necessary skill for anyone in any health profession, this course will provide you with the needed knowledge and equip you with the much needed skills of critical appraisal of evidence in health care that you can apply in your workplace and real life. This course also brings together knowledge you have gained in epidemiology, health education, and health policy in other courses in the public health major in Bachelor of Health Sciences.

- Write a reflective post on the following topic:

"The key components of Evidence Based Public Health (EBPH) include making decisions on the basis of the best available scientific evidence and using sound data collection and research methods together with engaging the community in the decision-making. An EBPH approach could potentially have numerous direct and indirect benefits, including access to more and higher-quality information on best practice, a higher likelihood of successful prevention programs and policies, greater workforce productivity, and more efficient use of public and private resources."

### A3. Critical appraisal of a research topic (45%, 45 marks, 16th October, 2020, 5 PM Hard deadline)

In this assignment, you will construct an evidence appraisal table based on **five identified intervention studies** on **one of the following three study questions or problems** using GRADEPRO GDT tool. You will then **write a commentary on the quality of the evidence** for the identified intervention-outcome combination. The questions are as follows:

**Q1. What is the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy compared with other forms of treatment for achieving smoking cessation in adults?**

**Q2. What is the effectiveness of social skills training compared with other interventions that are not based on social skills training for attention deficit hyperactivity disorders in people under 18 years of age?**

Step by step guidance:

- Step 0. Select a question to work on.
- Step 1. Construct a PICO formatted question (refer to the materials on 7th September)
- Step 2. Search literature databases on the PICO question (refer to materials on 14th September). There is no limit how many databases you want to search
- Step 3. Identify **five most appropriate** intervention studies from the search results. These studies must have your chosen intervention as the intervention, and the outcome as the outcome. Such intervention studies can be any design (RCT, before-after, others)
- Step 4. Obtain full texts of the studies and combine the results and enter them to GRADEPRO GDT to develop the gradepro evidence PORTFOLIO table
- Step 5. Write a commentary on the GRADEPRO PORTFOLIO table
- Step 6. Follow the template provided in Learn to write this paper.
- Step 7. Submit the paper **no later than** 16th October, 2020, 5 PM. **This is a hard deadline**. No submission will be accepted after this date.

### Assessment policy
This course will focus on qualitative not quantitative assessment, both with reference to your own work and the works we’re studying. While you will get a final grade, I will put questions and comments that engage your work rather than simply evaluate it. You will also be reflecting carefully on your own work and the work of your peers. The intention here is to help you focus on working in a more organic way, as opposed to working as you think you’re expected to. If this process causes more anxiety than it alleviates, see me or discuss with me at any point to confer about your progress in the course to date. If you are worried about your grade, your best strategy should be to join the discussions, do the reading, and complete the assignments. You should consider this course a “busy-work-free zone.” If an assignment does not feel productive, we can find ways to modify, remix, or repurpose the instructions.
