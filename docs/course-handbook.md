# HLTH301: Evidence in Health

## Description

"HLTH 301: Evidence in Health Care" aims to provide an overview of the nature of evidence, including current definitions and its evaluation and use in health care delivery decisions in a variety of settings. This is a 0.25 EFTS course (30 points course). This means you will need to spend 10 hours per week studying HLTH301 this semester (full time study hours per week = 40 hours). As critical appraisal of evidence is a necessary skill for anyone in any health profession, this course will provide you with the needed knowledge and equip you with the much needed skills of critical appraisal of evidence in health care that you can apply in your workplace and real life. This course also brings together knowledge you have gained in epidemiology, health education, and health policy in other courses in the public health major in Bachelor of Health Sciences.

### Assessment policy

This course will focus on qualitative not quantitative assessment, both with reference to your own work and the works we’re studying. While you will get a final grade, I will put questions and comments that engage your work rather than simply evaluate it. You will also be reflecting carefully on your own work and the work of your peers. The intention here is to help you focus on working in a more organic way, as opposed to working as you think you’re expected to. If this process causes more anxiety than it alleviates, see me or discuss with me at any point to confer about your progress in the course to date. If you are worried about your grade, your best strategy should be to join the discussions, do the reading, and complete the assignments. You should consider this course a “busy-work-free zone.” If an assignment does not feel productive, we can find ways to modify, remix, or repurpose the instructions.
