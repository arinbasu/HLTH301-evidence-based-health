# Syllabus for HLTH301

## Goals and objectives of the course

HLTH 301: Evidence in Health Care aims to provide an overview of the nature
of evidence, including current definitions and its evaluation and use in health
care delivery decisions in a variety of settings.
HLTH 301 is a 0.25 EFTS course ( 30 points course). This indicates
that you will need to spend 10 hours per week studying HLTH301 this semester
(full time study hours per week = 40 hours). we will meet face to face very week
2 hours (1 - 3 PM) on Mondays. Check your messages on Learn (and email box
or other means such as Ublend) for other, ADDITIONAL face to face meeting
times.
The goals of this course are as follows:

 - Learn about the role and use of evidence in health care, and
 - Build capacity/skills among students in critical appraisal.
 
 
After successful completion of this course, you will be able to demonstrate the meaning and application of the following terms and concepts:

- evidence based health
- Study designs in health
- how evidence is used to inform health policy framing and decision making
in NZ
- frame answerable research questions

## Description of the assessments

### Online open book MCQ (multiple choice questions)

The purpose of this component is to test your understanding of the concepts of evidence based health. We shall administer the test online with 35 multiple choice questions. You are allowed one hour from start to finish. The test will be administered on Learn, and will open at 9 AM on 23/8/2019 and close at 5 PM on 23/8/2019. The test is worth 35% of your assessment or total grade and will be marked by the computer.

Each of the 35 items of the test will consist of one stem and five possible answers. Only one of the answers is the correct answer to the question. There is no penalty for wrong answer. Each question is worth 1 point. If you select the wrong choice, you will get '0' for that question. Your total will be total number of correct answers. 

Example of a question:

Which of the following actions is part of evidence based healthcare practice?
- Provide opinions
- Seeking expert opinions
- Conduct a preliminary search of the popular websites
- Critically appraise a body of literature
- Clinically treat a patient based on past experience

The correct answer is the fourth choice, **Critically appraise a body of literature**. All the other four answers are not part of an evience based process. 

The test is open book and we do not require that you take the test at an appointed hour at a specific place. This means you can take the test anywhere and anytime between 9 AM and 5 PM. You are responsible for arranging your own internet connection to take the test. We recommend that you take the test at the University of Canterbury campus (at the library or at a computer laboratory). If you get disconnected for any reason during the test, the test may record answers you saved upto the point of disconnection, and we will mark you on that basis. No retest will be given to you. You can apply for an aegrotat if you like. 

We recommend that you take the practice tests on Learn and familiarise yourself with the kind of questions that you may expect. The type and difficulty of the questions will be similar to the ones we release on Learn. 

So, to recap:

- This exam accounts for 35% of your grade and has 35 questions, each question worth 1 mark.
- This is a multiple choice examination that has five choices and only one of them is correct
- The test will be offered only once between 9 am - 5 pm on 23/8/2019
- The test is online and will live on learn
- It is your responsibility to take the test and no adjustment will be made if you are unable to finish the test for whatever reason
- You will need to answer 35 questions in 60 minutes
- You can use books/resources and notes to answer this test (it is an open-book test)


### Assignment II: Forum posts

This assignment is designed to test your ability to **apply** everything you learned in the course in a real world setting where you will be able to:

- State a position on a topic
- Spot an argument
- Either defend or refute the argument
- Identify what evidence is presented or needs to be presented
- Write about it
- Communicate in a friendly yet using principles of evidence based practice

Between 13/9/2019 and 27/9/2019, we will run a forum where we will post a question seeking your opinion and what evidence you can support in defense of your opinion or idea. We will run this over two weeks. In these two weeks, you will:

- **Start your own post** by writing your comment in response to the statement we will post
- **Respond to other students' comments**; you can respond to an individual student, or you can respond to more than one student's comments collectively in a single post. You can only write ONE main post and ONE response post.
- Each week you will write two posts, so **you should write a total of four posts over two weeks**. You are not allowed to write more than two posts in a week. 
- Each week, one post will be to state your own position, and the other post on the week to respond to a fellow student's statement or position
- The posts you write must reflect everything you have learned on the course, and you must engage in a polite and civil discourse (violation of politeness and civil discourse or failing to engage in a civilised manner will automatically get you a failing grade in this assignment)
- We, the lecturers in this course, will not participate in the forum or post discussions, but we will monitor the forum. 

After the forum closes on 27/9/2019 5 PM, we will collect all posts and will mark the posts on the basis of:

- Quality of your argument and writing (clarity, grace, and style of your writing)
- How well you used evidence to support your position
- How well you wrote your own position 
- How well you responded to your fellow student's position

We will grade you on a range between 0 - 20

### Assignmet III: Critical appraisal of a body of evidence

The purpose of this assessment is to understand for us the extent to which you have understood how to critically appraise a body of evidence not just by an article by article basis, but also how, given an outcome, you can identify a body of evidence of primary resources and then will develop a grading of the evidence at hand. Therefore, in this assessment, you will be provided with a challenging scenario, and you will in response

- Convert the scenario to an answerable question using PICO (you will learn about PICO in the course)
- Search at least three scholarly databases with the terms
- Identify primary research papers on the most relevant outcomes related to the scenario
- Critically appraise the research papers to arrive at a grading of evidence
- Write about it

We will provide you with five problems. Choose any one of them, and develop a grading of available evidence:

1. What quality of evidence exists that myringotomy with grommet insertion is an effective treatment for improving hearing outcomes for chronic secretory otitis media (also known as "glue ear") in children under ten years of age?
2. What quality of evidence exists that nicotine replacement therapy is effective for smoking cessation for young adults?
3. Examine and grade the quality of evidence on the effectiveness of social skills training for controlling attention deficit hyperactivity disorders in children?
4. Are oral antibiotics effective and safe for treating pain in irreversible pulpitis (inflammation of the nerve inside the tooth/nerve damage) for adults? Grade the evidence for beneficial effects and harms
5. Grade the quality of evidence on the effects of lifestyle interventions on reproductive, and quality of life outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome

You will need to do the following:

1. Pick ONE problem.
2. Frame an answerable research question based on PICO
3. Conduct a search on these questions in at least three databases (the more databases, the better)
4. Select ONE specific outcome for each of benefit and harm (you need to select one beneficial outcome and one harmful outcome)
5. Select as many studies as you can. You can select as many studies as you can but you should select at least three studies for each outcome. You should select studies appropriate for each outcome and studies that will likely to provide you with the best evidence
6. Use GRADEPRO GDT tool to synthesise the evidence and arrive at a quality assessment table
7. Summarise and describe your work in the form of a written text document.

The document you write ("your output") must include the following:

- A title of the paper
- An introduction and background to the problem
- Step by step description of your method. The method must include the PICO question, the search process, selection of studies, and assessment of evidence
- A GRADE evidence table
- A discussion section where you will summarise the findings from your research, and describe the implication of the findings
- A list of references (there is no upper or lower limit as to how many references you must include in the study) written in APA 6 style
- The text of the document must be between 1000-1500 words (roughly two to three pages). The word count does not include words in the tables, figures, and reference sections. Words everywhere else will count.
- If the word count is less than 1000 words or more than 1500, we will deduct 5% from your marks for this assignment. 
- You can include as many figures and tables as you want in the document
- You must submit the document as a PDF to Learn
- We will provide you with a template with instructions how to use it. Use the template and follow the instructions in the template (You will learn how to use the template in this course)
- DO NOT include a cover sheet, this is not necessary for this assignment!
- You must submit by 18/10/2019 5 PM. We will not accept late submissions. You are eligible to apply for an aegrotat for this component if you cannot submit on time due to any reason. 

What we will assess when we will grade this component of assessment:

- We will rate the title: how well the title corresponds to the rest of the paper
- Your discussion of the problem and how well you demonstrate you understand the problem under review
- Details of your description of the methods (the search process and correctness of the search)
- Grade table (correctly filled in the grade table)
- Your quality of discussion

You will get a grade between 0-45 and detailed comments/feedback. 

## Conclusion

In summary, HLTH301 is a course on evidence-based health. You will learn how to frame answerable questions, how to search literature, and how to appraise evidence. We will also cover clinical epidemiology and risk assessment. The course work will prepare you with skills that you can use to critically appraise health literature. We will assess your skills in appraising and writing about your critical appraisals using a multiple choice question based examination, a discussion, and an essay. We will use a textbook and several lectures and reading assignments. We hope you will enjoy this course.
