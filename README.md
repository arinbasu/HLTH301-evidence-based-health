## Description of the assessments

### Online open book MCQ

The purpose of this component is to test your understanding of the concepts of evidence based health. We shall administer the test online with 35 multiple choice questions. You are allowed one hour from start to finish. The test will be administered on Learn, and will open at 9 AM on 23/8/2019 and close at 5 PM on 23/8/2019. The test is worth 35% of your assessment or total grade and will be marked by the computer.

Each of the 35 items of the test will consist of one stem and five possible answers. Only one of the answers is the correct answer to the question. There is no penalty for wrong answer. Each question is worth 1 point. If you select the wrong choice, you will get '0' for that question. Your total will be total number of correct answers. 

Example of a question:

Which of the following actions is part of evidence based healthcare?
- Provide opinions
- Seeking expert opinions
- Conduct a preliminary search of the popular websites
- **Critically appraise a body of literature**
- Clinically treat a patient based on past experience

The correct answer is the fourth choice, **Critically appraise a body of literature**. All the other four answers are not part of an evience based process. 

The test is open book and we do not require that you take the test at an appointed hour at a specific place. This means you can take the test anywhere and anytime between 9 AM and 5 PM. You are responsible for arranging your own internet connection to take the test. We recommend that you take the test at the University of Canterbury campus (at the library or at a computer laboratory). If you get disconnected for any reason during the test, the test may record answers you saved upto the point of disconnection, and we will mark you on that basis. No retest will be given to you. You can apply for an aegrotat if you like. 

We recommend that you take the practice tests on Learn and familiarise yourself with the kind of questions that you may expect. The type and difficulty of the questions will be similar to the ones we release on Learn.
